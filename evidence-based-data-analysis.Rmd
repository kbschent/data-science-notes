### Replication and Reproducibility
- Replication  
    - Focuses on the validity of the scientific claim  
    - "Is this claim true"  
    - The ultimate standard for strengthening scientific evidence  
    - New investigators, data, analytical methods, laboratories, instruments, etc.  
    - Particularly important in studies that can impact broad policy or regulatory decisions  
- Reproducibility  
    - Focuses on the validity of the data analysis  
    - "Can we trust this analysis"  
    - Arguably a minimum standard for any scientific study  
    - New investigators, same data, same methods  
    - Important when replication is impossible 

### Background and Underlying Trends  
- Some studies cannot be replicated: No time, no money, unique/opportunistic  
- Technology is increasing data collection throughput, data are more complex and high-dimensional  
- Existing databases can be merged to become bigger databases (but data are used off-label)  
- Computing power allows more sophisticated analyses, even on "small" data  
- For every field "X" there is a "Computational X"  

### The Result?  
- Even basic analyses are difficult to describe  
- Heavy computational requirements are thrust upon people without adequate training in statistics and computing  
- Errors are more easily introduced into long analysis pipelines  
- Knowledge of transfer is inhibited  
- Results are difficult to replicate or reproduce  
- Complicated analyses cannot be trusted
